; A RULE is a a function that:
; - Takes a state and returns either nil
;   or a vector pair.
;   - A STATE is a struct map that contains
;     a remainder and maybe info.
;     You create states using the BasicState function.
;   - A REMAINDER is a sequence or
;     seqable collection of tokens.
;     It is contained in the
;     :name.choi.joshua.fnparse/remainder key.
;   - A state can also contain INFO, which are
;     any other attributes in the state. Common
;     examples include current line and column numbers
;     and a set of current warnings.
; - If the remainder is VALID under the rule,
;   it CONSUMES any valid tokens and returns a RESULT.
;   - A RESULT is a vector pair containing
;     a product and a new state.
;   - The PRODUCT is the semantic data generated
;     by the rule that corresponds to the
;     information represented by the consumed tokens.
;     It can be any object.
;   - The new state is what the old state now looks like,
;     after its first few tokens are consumed.
; - If the given token sequence is INVALID, then
;   the rule FAILS, meaning that it simply returns NIL.
