; A rule is a delay object that contains a function that:
; - Takes a collection of tokens.
; - If the token sequence is valid, it returns a (0) vector containing the (1)
;   consumed symbols' products and (2) a state data object, usually a map. The
;   state contains the (3) sequence of remaining tokens, usually with the key
;   *remainder-accessor*.
; - If the given token sequence is invalid, then the rule Fails, meaning that it
;   simply returns nil.

; - (0) is called the rule's Result.
; - (1) is called the rule's Product.
; - (2) is called the rule's State.
; - (3) is called the rule's Remainder.

    This is for customization of states, which affect

    You customize by providing as a template a map of
    your states' desired keys and their default values.
    
    In addition, you get a speed boost from the automatic
    generation and use of a struct map and accessors, which
    are invisibly used by make-state and all rules.
    
    This form uses the binding form, so the context formed
    is thread-specific.
    
    You can (and must, if you use things like memoizing
    rules) provide a special info addition recipe in the
    template with the key :name.choi.joshua.fnparse/add-info.
    Corresponding to it would be a two-argument function that
    merges its second argument (a state) into the first
    argument (another state). This is important. It is
    essential if you use the memo rule-maker. Read the example
    below to learn how to implement a proper add-info.
    
    Here is an example to make it clearer how you
    customize states. Let's say that I want my states to
    store: (1) any warnings that a rule might want to raise
    for the user during parsing, (2) the current line number,
    and (3) the current column number. Also, whenever two
    states are merged, I want to do it in a particular way.
    I want the warnings to simply be merged together. Also, I
    want the new state's line and column to similarly be
    the sum of the lines and column of the two states.
    
    But! if the line of the second state's column is above zero,
    then that means that merging the second state into the
    first state should RESET the new column number, since the
    new state is at a new line, a different line from the first
    state! Here's the code...
