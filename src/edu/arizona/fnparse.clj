  _FnParse 3_ is a *pair* of libraries that can create
  *unambiguous parsers*.
  
  Overview: Would FnParse be useful for you?
  ==========================================
  _FnParse Hound_ and _FnParse Cat_ are two libraries that
  can both create *unambiguous parsers*, but of slightly
  different varieties.
  
  When does one need parsers? *Any time you need to turn
  text into information via a language.* Data is always
  stored in \"text\" of *some* kind, whether it be an English
  sentence, a DNA sequence, or an XML file.
  
  FnParse can write [PEGs](http://www.en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PEG),
  an easy way to write unambiguous grammars.
  This means that FnParse parsers can represent languages
  whose sentences always have one meaning. Examples of
  ambiguous languages include Clojure, XML, HTML5, YAML,
  JSON, Python, Markdown, and most other computer languages.
  FnParse can indeed parse data in all those languages above.
  I think. :)
  
  How to learn FnParse
  ====================
  TODO
  
  A note on this namespace's vars
  ===============================
  This namespace itself contains common stuff that both
  FnParse Cat and FnParse Hound use.
  It is not meant to be used by you; use FnParse Cat or Hound instead.
  
  However, this documentation here does contain basic information
  relevant to both libraries.
  
  Similarities between FnParse Hound and Cat
  ==========================================
  FnParse Hound and Cat share very similar APIs. In fact, with
  a couple of exceptions listed in the next section, their APIs
  seem identical.
  
  Both FnParse Hound and Cat create _rules_. Rule are
  functions that eat tokens and turn them into data.
  
  *  A _token_ is a unit of text. Tokens are usually characters,
     because that's easiest to do. (You might already have a
     lexer, however, that turns characters into other tokens,
     which FnParse parsers can use too. Just be consistent
     on what kind of tokens a parser can accept.)
  *  A rule accepts a _state object_, which contains
     a _sequence of tokens_ and a _context_, as an argument.
  *  A rule determines if the tokens are valid or not
     according to its definition; it either _succeeds_ or
     _fails_.
  *  When a rule succeeds, it _consumes_ some tokens (zero or more)
     and calculates the data that those tokens represent. This
     new data is called the _product_. The rule then
     returns an object called an _answer_, which contains
     both the product and the new state.
  *  When a rule fails, it creates an _error_ that contains
     information on why the tokens were invalid for that rule.
  *  Rules consume tokens from the beginning of the sequence.
  
  (FnParse Cat rules and FnParse Hound rules are *not*
  the same and are *incompatible* with each other. The
  same goes for Cat and Hound states and answers.)
  
  FnParse Cat and Hound both use the same _error_ type: the
  `:edu.arizona.fnparse/ParseError` type.
  
  Differences between FnParse Hound and Cat
  =========================================
  Overview with fancy terms
  -------------------------
  FnParse Hound creates [Parsec]
  (http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Parsec)-like,
  [LL(1)][ll-1] or near-LL(1) parsers.
  FnParse Cat is a [packrat parser](http://en.wikipedia.org/Packrat parser).
  *All* other differences stem from these two fundamental ones.
  
  Overview with plainer language
  ------------------------------
  FnParse Hound's parsers try to save as much memory as possible.
  In general, as soon as a Hound parser consumes a token, that
  token is discarded forever. This means that you can't backtrack
  through your tokens if a rule fails. For some languages, you
  want this kind of parser, because those languages are designed
  to be able to be interpreted by looking at only one token at
  a time: a lookahead of one.
  
  FnParse Cat's parsers take up a lot of memory, but they can
  quickly parse more complex parsers. In general, when a Cat parser
  consumes tokens, it saves the parse result from those tokens
  in a cache. This means that there's unlimited backtracking
  and lookahead. In addition, Cat parsers support [left
  recursion](left-recur), a very useful way of expressing rules.
  You want this kind of languages for relatively complex grammars
  that require a lot of backtracking.
  
  When should you use which FnParse
  ---------------------------------
  Many computer data languages are LL(1) or near-LL(1). You
  should use _FnParse Hound_ for those. Examples include:
  
  *  [Clojure](http://www.clojure.org)
  *  [XML](http://www.w3.org/XML)
  *  [JSON](http://json.org)
  *  [YAML](http://yaml.org)
  *  [CSV](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values)
  
  Many other, more complex computer programming languages
  are not LL(1). Some of them involve left recursion.
  
  *  Standard mathematical expressions (like in [Google
     Calculator](http://www.google.com/calculator))
  *  [Python](http://www.python.org)
  *  [Java](http://www.java.com)
  *  Even [Lojban](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lojban)
  
  Detailed comparison between Hound and Cat
  =========================================
  You won't understand this chart until you've learned either Hound
  or Cat well.
  
                     | Hound                  | Cat
  ------------------ | ---------------------- | -------------------
  Better for         | Potentially large data | More complex data
  Backtracking[^0]   | None by default[^1]    | Unlimited
  Caching of results | No[^2]                 | Yes
  Greedy repetition  | Yes[^3]                | No[^4]
  Right recursion    | Yes                    | Yes
  Left recursion     | No                     | Yes
  Context alteration | Yes[^5]                | No[^6]
  
  [^0]:
      The differences in backtracking comes from the differences
      between the `+` operator in Hound and Cat.
  [^1]:
      Backtracking in Hound rules is possible using the `lex`
      rule-maker, but it should be minimized.
  [^2]:
      In fact, it does the opposite: it tries to prevent
      *any* caching of results to reduce memory.
  [^3]:
      Greedy repetition in Hound is done by the `rep` function
      and its friends. Of course, it can be always rewritten to use
      right-recursive rules instead.
  [^4]:
      In Cat, you want to use left or right recursion instead.
  [^5]:
      In Hound, contexts can be altered in-place using the
      `alter-context` rule-maker, but you should usually
      prefer using custom rule-makers with `defmaker` instead,
      which is just as powerful.
  [^6]:
      Use custom rule-makers with `defmaker` if your grammar
      is context-sensitive. TODO: Python example
