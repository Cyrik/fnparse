fnparse is a library for creating functional parsers in the Clojure programming
language. It presents an easy, functional way to create parsers from EBNF rules and
was inspired by the paper Using Functional Parsing to Achieve Quality in Software
Maintenance (http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/148293.html).

fnparse's distribution has src and test folders. To use fnparse, download this
distribution and include its src folder in your program's classpathâ€”for instance,
  java -cp $CLOJURE_PATH:path-to-fnparse/fnparse/src/ ...

fnparse's namespace is name.choi.joshua.fnparse. 

fnparse's unit tests are stored in the tests folder and require the test-is library
from clojure-contrib, the Clojure standard library.
